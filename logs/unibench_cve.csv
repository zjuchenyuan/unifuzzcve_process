The MTKLogger app with a package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely, the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application components are exported since they contain an intent filter, are not protected by a custom permission, and do not explicitly set the android:exported attribute to false. Therefore, these components are exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party application by using android.content.Intent object for communication. These application components can be used to start and stop the logs using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS log, modem log, network log, and mobile log. The base directory that contains the directories for the 4 types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog which makes them accessible to apps that require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. The GPS log contains the GPS coordinates of the user as well as a timestamp for the coordinates. The modem log contains AT commands and their parameters which allow the user's outgoing and incoming calls and text messages to be obtained. The network log is a tcpdump network capture. The mobile log contains the Android log, which is not available to third-party apps as of Android 4.1.

CVE-2018-15004,Candidate,"The Coolpad Canvas device with a build fingerprint of Coolpad/cp3636a/cp3636a:7.0/NRD90M/093031423:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that contains an exported service app component named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app on the device to set certain system properties as the com.android.phone user. When an app sets the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 1, an app with a package name of com.yulong.logredirect (versionCode=20160622, versionName=5.25_20160622_01) will start writing the system-wide logcat log, kernel log, and a tcpdump network traffic capture to external storage. Furthermore, on the Coolpad Canvas device, the com.android.phone app writes the destination phone number and body of the text message for outgoing text messages. A notification when logging can be avoided if the log is enabled after device startup and disabled prior to device shutdown by setting the system properties using the exported interface of the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app. Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access the log files.","MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/   |   MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf",Assigned (20180805),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
