CVE-2017-11613	In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the TIFFOpen function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.

When a crafted NSV file, which claims a large "table_entries_used" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop over 'table_entries_used' would consume huge CPU resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
CVE-2017-14223	In libavformat/asfdec_f.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in asf_build_simple_index() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted ASF file, which claims a large "ict" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the for loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
CVE-2017-9993	FFmpeg before 2.8.12, 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.9, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, and 3.3.x before 3.3.2 does not properly restrict HTTP Live Streaming filename extensions and demuxer names, which allows attackers to read arbitrary files via crafted playlist data.
